Here are the steps to create, test, and possibly enhance your password strength checker script based on the code you've provided. I'll break it down into manageable steps, including setting up a GitHub repository if you want to share your work.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

 **Choose a Programming Environment**: You can use any Python IDE (like PyCharm, or VSCode) or a simple text editor (like Notepad++).
 **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python. org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Create the Password Strength Checker

 **Create a New File**: Create a new Python file. You could name it something like `password_strength_checker.py`.

 **Copy the Code**: Paste the password strength checker code you've provided into your new file:

   ```python
   import re

   def check_password_strength(password):
       """
       Checks the strength of a password based on length, complexity, and uniqueness.

       Args:
           password (str): The password to be checked.

       Returns:
           str: A string indicating the password strength ("Weak", "Medium", "Strong").
       """

       length_score = 0
       complexity_score = 0
       uniqueness_score = 0

       # Length score
       if len(password) < 8:
           length_score = 1
       elif len(password) < 12:
           length_score = 2
       else:
           length_score = 3

       # Complexity score
       if re.search(r"[a-z]", password) and re.search(r"[A-Z]", password) and re.search(r"[0-9]", password) and re.search(r"[!@#$%^&*(),.?\":{}|<>]", password):
           complexity_score = 3
       elif re.search(r"[a-z]", password) and re.search(r"[A-Z]", password) and re.search(r"[0-9]", password):
           complexity_score = 2
       elif re.search(r"[a-z]", password) and re.search(r"[A-Z]", password):
           complexity_score = 1
       else:
           complexity_score = 0

       # Uniqueness score (simplistic check)
       if len(set(password)) / len(password) > 0.7:
           uniqueness_score = 2
       elif len(set(password)) / len(password) > 0.5:
           uniqueness_score = 1
       else:
           uniqueness_score = 0

       total_score = length_score + complexity_score + uniqueness_score

       if total_score < 4:
           return "Weak"
       elif total_score < 7:
           return "Medium"
       else:
           return "Strong"


   # Example usage
   password = input("Enter a password: ")
   strength = check_password_strength(password)
   print(f"Password strength: {strength}")
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Functionality

1. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where your Python file is saved, and run the script:
   ```bash
   python password_strength_checker.py
   ```

2. **Input Passwords**: Provide different passwords as input to test various scenarios (e.g., weak, medium, strong).

### Step 4: Enhance Functionality (Optional)

Here are some suggestions for enhancing your password strength checker:

- **Feedback Mechanism**: Modify the output to specify which aspects of the password are weak (e.g., length, complexity).
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Create a simple GUI using libraries such as Tkinter or PyQt.
- **Add a Database**: Store user passwords (hashed, of course) and check their strength against previously used passwords.

### Step 5: Version Control (Using GitHub)


 **Initialize Git in Your Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

 **Add Your Files**:
   ```bash
   git add password_strength_checker.py
   ```

 **Commit Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Add password strength checker"
   ```

 **Link Your Local Repository to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Brainwave_Matrix_Intern/password-strength-checker.git
   ```

 **Push Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 6: Document Your Project

1. **Create a README.md**: In your project folder, create a `README.md` file to describe your project. Include the following:
   - A brief description of what the project does.
   - How to install and run the script.
   - Examples of usage.
   - Any additional notes on future enhancements.

### Step 7: Share and Collaborate

1. **Make Your Repository Public**: If it is not already, you can change your repository settings on GitHub to allow others to view and collaborate on your code.
