To successfully install and run the **Password Strength Checker** you developed, follow these installation steps. These instructions will assume you're using Python, but I can provide guidance for other programming languages if needed.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

1. **Install Python**
   - If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official site: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Ensure you check the box to add Python to your PATH during installation.

2. **Install Git (Optional)**
   - If you want to clone your repository using Git, install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the GitHub repository 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Brainwave_Matrix_Intern/password_strength_checker.git
   ```
3. Navigate into the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd /password_strength_checker
   ```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment helps manage dependencies for your project.

1. To create a virtual environment, run:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **On Windows:**
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **On macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate

### How to Use the Password Strength Checker

1. **Run the Application**

   If you’ve followed the earlier steps and have your environment set up, you simply need to execute the script. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory where your `password_strength_checker.py` file is located, and run:

   ```bash
   python3 password_strength_checker
   ```

2. **Enter a Password**

   Once the script runs, it will prompt you to enter a password. For example:

   ```
   Enter a password: 
   ```

3. **Receive Feedback on Password Strength**

   After you input a password and press "Enter," the tool will analyze it based on predefined criteria (length, complexity, and uniqueness) and provide feedback. Here’s how it might respond based on different password inputs:

   - **Weak Password Example:**
     ```
     Enter a password: 1234
     Password strength: weak 

   - **Moderate Password Example:**
     ```
     Enter a password: P@ssword1
     Password strength: Medium

   - **Strong Password Example:**
     ```
     Enter a password: Str0ng!Password2024
     Password strength: strong      

### Example Usage

Here’s a hypothetical session with the password strength checker:

```plaintext
$ python password_strength_checker.py
Enter a password: 12345
Weak: Password must be at least 8 characters.
   
Enter a password: halya098@
Medium: Good effort! Adding more variety could enhance strength.

Enter a password: My$ecUr3P@ssw0rd!
Strong: Great job! Your password is strong.
```
