To successfully install and run the **Password Strength Checker** you developed, follow these installation steps. These instructions will assume you're using Python, but I can provide guidance for other programming languages if needed.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

1. **Install Python**
   - If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official site: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Ensure you check the box to add Python to your PATH during installation.

2. **Install Git (Optional)**
   - If you want to clone your repository using Git, install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the GitHub repository (replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Brainwave_Matrix_Intern/password_strength_checker.git
   ```
3. Navigate into the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd /password_strength_checker
   ```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment helps manage dependencies for your project.

1. To create a virtual environment, run:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **On Windows:**
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **On macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

If your project uses any additional packages (for example, Flask if you decided to make a web app), you should install them here. For the basic password strength checker we’ve set up, no additional dependencies are necessary, but you can create a `requirements.txt` file if you later add libraries.

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory and include any dependencies:
   ```
   # Example content (add if needed)
   flask
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 5: Run Your Password Strength Checker Tool

1. Make sure you're still in the password strength checker directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python password_strength_checker.py
   ```
